# DSMRLoggerAPI-UI

Standalone UI for MrWheels DSMRLoggerAPI

The development of this UI is disconnected from MrWheels API development.

Current version of this UI does not support negative reading (as seen with solar pannels).

Install the 3phase.* file on your DSM logger's data directory and set 3phase.html to be your standard web-page.

Alternatively, install these files on any device and change the first line in 3phase.js to refer to the DSMRLoggerAPI device
